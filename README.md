DATABASE
** This is a short file for this portfolio on databases

- I am on a Journey to Data Engineering and one of the core concepts i believe should help me is learning SQL or rather renewing my SQL skills.
I am currently learning the T-Sql dilect, reason been my research showed me a trend in companies in South Africa adopting the use of Azure services which the SQL Server side of it using this dilect.

- This is a continuos project from the beginner level of T-SQL to advance and by time it ends i will be on that level so wish me luck and all the best to you my fellow Sequeler

TOOLS AND COMPONENTS
- SQL Server database engine on LocalDB (Currently broke and exhausted my free credits Opps)
- SQL Server Management Studio : We will be writing all the queries here (Dont worry , i will extract the database for you weekly)
- All the SQL files are version controlled here with each folder representing a learning milestone (if its empty i am not there yet)

** The whole aim is to mirror real production deployments

SCENARIO:
Thendo’s Bank – Core Banking & Transaction Analytics System

Thendo’s Bank is a growing digital retail bank operating in South Africa.
The bank offers customers savings, cheque, and credit accounts, supports internal and external transfers, and provides transaction analytics for customers, auditors, and management.

The bank is building an internal SQL Server–based system to:

- Manage customers and accounts
- Process financial transactions safely
- Ensure data integrity and auditability
- Support reporting, analysis, and performance optimization
- Enforce security and access control

This database will evolve incrementally, just like a real system, as progress is made from beginner to advanced T-SQL.
